    <p>Burglary has been a major problem faced by humans for so long and with time, has greatly advanced, becoming more sophisticated alongside modern technology.
        Tools and devices has been developed to make theft and break-ins easy.
        With the growing need for reliable security, many low cost solutions for security systems have now emerge.
        Many homes today, are invaded mostly by force, either through breaching a window, entering through the celling or even entering through a closed door or window.
        This project is being developed to aid home owners to fight against the preceding danger of break-ins and also to enable them afford low-cost and effective security.
        This project work presents a Burglary Alarm System using Motion Sensors and GSM Module, which is responsible for monitoring and alarming home owners of intrusion.
        The Burglary Alarm System comprises of an Arduino Board with an embedded microcontroller ATmega328p which is an open source computer hardware and software, a Passive Infrared
        (PIR) sensor, a Vibration sensor, a Piezoelectric Buzzer, a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM/GPRS) module. The Arduino acts as the central processing unit or control unit
        of the system, the PIR sensor and Vibration sensor acts as the monitoring or detection unit.</p>
